{{< blocks/cover title="About RoverCore" image_anchor="bottom" height="min" >}}

<p class="lead mt-5">RoverCore is designed for beginner to intermediate ASP.NET core developers to learn how to develop ASP.NET SaaS applications. The project is a .NET 6 monolithic architecture that incorporates Entity Framework and excludes patterns like CQRS and Repositories that you might find in other starter projects.  This allows you
  as a developer the freedom to decide how you want to create your application context boundaries.
