Welcome to the RoverCore Boilerplate Documentation project.  Our goal is to provide you with all the information you need to get started with developing using this framework.

Please note that this documentation is written in a tutorial style with a focus on teaching developers unfamiliar with ASP.NET concepts some of the core fundamentals of the framework along with guides that explain what went into the development of RoverCore.

We strongly recommend using this site in tandom with the official [ASP.NET documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/?view=aspnetcore-6.0).  Microsoft has done an excellent job developing a myriad of tutorials that provide insight into some of the concepts we will be covering in this documentation.  For your benefit, we will often link to supporting articles to help you learn more about the concepts we are discussing.
