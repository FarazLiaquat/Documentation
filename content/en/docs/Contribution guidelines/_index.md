  How to contribute to RoverCore and Documentation

## What is allowed
Anything on the RoverCore & Documentation GitHub repository can be changed. We, the maintainers, are extremely happy to have community support and feedback.

## Pull Requests
You've made a change? Awesome! First let's get a pull request made. You can do this by going to your repository. After that, go to "Pull Requests" and select the main branch for the appropriate repository.

After you have done that, create a little description about what the change does, and submit it. Once the maintainers receive it, they will look at it and converse with you there.
## I want to change something, what should I do?
Good question! We recommend you fork the appropriate repository first. This allows you to have full access to it, as if it were your own, whilst not interfering with the official repository.

After you fork the repository, create a branch preferably with your initials, then a dash separating your initials and the branch name. Below is an example.
> vl-example-refactor

Here the user has the initials "VL" and they are refactoring something called example.

After you commit and push your changes normally, submit a pull request on the appropriate GitHub Repository.
