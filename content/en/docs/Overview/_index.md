## What is RoverCore?

RoverCore is an easy-to-use, efficient, and simple ASP.NET 6 boilerplate. A boilerplate is essentially a template, with lots of tools and key parts that a developer may need for their project.  RoverCore is organized as an n-Tiered Architecture and borrows ideas from Clean Architecture. Most boilerplate frameworks you come across are highly opinionated on how to organize your project.  This can sometimes put you in a situation where you may have to write far more code for simple tasks and cause you to get lost in the magic of how the framework functions. RoverCore provides a solid boilerplate that provides you with a lot of the functionality you will need for smaller projects.  

This is a big step up from the default ASP.NET MVC template, and provides a starting point where you can implement the functionality you want within the system. As you learn how to use the framework you will become well-versed in how to develop ASP.NET applications and can begin the process of developing your own architecture ideas.

## Why RoverCore?

RoverCore was designed to be a starting project that can be used both by professionals and individuals learning how to develop ASP.NET 6 applications. The project contains work by students and was designed originally for educational purposes.  Don't let that scare you off, as the intention for this project is to be production-ready.
